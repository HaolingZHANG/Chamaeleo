**Chamaeleo** is currently the only collection focused on different codec methods for DNA storage.
This kit is mainly developed and operated by Synthetic Platform of BGI-Research, for a detailed list of authors, see [**authors.md**](https://github.com/ntpz870817/Chamaeleo/blob/master/docs/source/authors.md).
It provides you a chance to use the classical DNA encoding and decoding methods to save files into DNA motifs or load them from DNA motifs.
